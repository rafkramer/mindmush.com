        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: January 15, 2025</p>

        <p class="intro">MINDMUSH LLC, based in Delaware, United States, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our mobile games and services. By using our games, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined below.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use our mobile games and services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

        <h3>a. Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We collect non-personal information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (e.g., type, operating system, IP address).</li>
            <li>Game usage data (e.g., levels completed, in-game purchases).</li>
            <li>General user behavior and interaction within the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used to improve our services and enhance your gaming experience.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services to improve your experience and facilitate key features within our games:</p>

        <h3>a. App Stores</h3>
        <p>For in-app purchases, we use Apple App Store and Google Play Store. These platforms process transactions and manage payment information.</p>

        <h3>b. AppLovin</h3>
        <p>We utilize AppLovin for ad mediation to deliver personalized ads within the game.</p>

        <h3>c. Tapjoy</h3>
        <p>We use Tapjoy for offerwalls, which provide opportunities to earn in-game rewards through interacting with ads.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and maintain our games and services.</li>
            <li>Personalize in-game content and advertisements.</li>
            <li>Improve game performance and user experience.</li>
            <li>Process in-app purchases through app stores.</li>
            <li>Offer rewards through Tapjoy's offerwalls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share non-personal information with third-party service providers like AppLovin, Tapjoy, and app stores to facilitate ads, game performance analytics, and in-app purchases.</p>

        <div class="app-specific">
            <h3>Specifically for the "FaceKit" app:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Face Collection Data:</strong> The app collects face-related data using Apple's TrueDepth API and ARKit when the user explicitly initiates a facial scan. This data includes 3D facial geometry (face mesh), depth data used to construct the mesh, a texture image mapped to the mesh, and derived facial measurements calculated from the mesh. No face data is collected passively or without user action.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Face Data:</strong> Face data is used solely for facial proportion analysis and aesthetic evaluation. The app calculates facial measurements such as symmetry, proportions, and feature ratios, generates a beauty score and visual analysis, and enables before-and-after comparisons over time. Face data is not used for identity verification, authentication, Face ID, biometric identification, or user recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Face Data Storage and Retention:</strong> Facial mesh and texture data are stored securely in cloud storage provided by Supabase for the purpose of performing analysis and allowing users to access their results. Face data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide these features and is deleted when the user deletes a scan or their account.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Sharing of Face Data:</strong> The app does not share face data with any third parties. Face data is not sold, licensed, or disclosed to external entities.</li>
                <li><strong>User Consent and Control:</strong> All facial scans are initiated explicitly by the user. Users have full control over their face data and may delete their scans or account at any time, which permanently removes associated face data from our systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate measures to protect the information we collect. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove the data.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your information. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at the address provided below.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. Significant updates will be posted within the game or on our website. Please check this policy periodically for updates.</p>
